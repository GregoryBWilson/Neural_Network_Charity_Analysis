# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## **Overview of the analysis:** 

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## **Results:** 

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

  

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
